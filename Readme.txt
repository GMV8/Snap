This project is built to run under .net core 3.1 framework
It uses nunit 3 for testing and includes all the relevant packages to run it using visual studio 2019 in the solution<Snap Test Project>

The snap progrm can be run by following the on screen instructions
It firstly asks for the number of packs you want to use for the snap game
It then asks how to judge a snap condition

It will then run the snap game and print the outcome.

If I had more time -

-Implemented have/ have not jokers in the pack
-I would've written more unit tests, for each of the interface calls
-Used an inversion of control container
-Used a factory pattern
-Put in more error checking
